# Backstory

Hjaldar was born in a Mountain Dwarf city, son to a middle-class worker’s family. At the age of twenty, his city was attacked. In the chaos of battle, he lost sight of his parents, and suddenly faced a group of ferocious monsters. With nothing but a club in his hands, his chances of survival seemed feeble. Hjaldar looked towards the sky and said his last prayers while the foes approached. But instead of clouds and blue, a strange image appeared before Hjaldar’s eyes: A set of divine kneecaps lit up the sky. Hjaldar could at first not believe his eyes, but when a thundering crack broke the kneecaps into threecaps, a divine kneecap-breaking purpose flooded his veins, and he fell into a rage, mutilating his enemies’ kneecaps one by one.

Despite Hjaldars heroic kneecap-breaking efforts, the battle was lost, and Hjaldar was forced to flee. He did not remember much of the incident except for blacking out, and waking up to a vista of broken kneecaps. Hjaldar wandered the lands for weeks, killing animals with his bare hands to survive. The thought of survival filled Hjaldars entire consciousness, pushing the memory of his kneecap-frenzy further back every day. After a long time of wandering and scavenging, Hjaldar reached a human village. There, he found refuge, and more: A family.

A childless couple took Hjaldar as their son, raising him as if he was human. Hjaldar was slow to warm up to them, but with each year his bond to them grew stronger, and the memory of his dwarven parents and the memory of the attack became weaker.

To live and thrive in the human community helped Hjaldar suppress his painful past, to the point that he became fully convinced that he must have been human all along.

When Hjaldar turned fifty, he could no longer bear the painful reality of his dwarven name and body; to believe himself a human while standing a mere meter tall, was frustrating. Any provocation from taller beings, especially comments on his height or dwarven origin, sent him into a kneecap-breaking rage. The villagers tolerated this, but the older Hjaldar became, the harder his club struck their kneecaps, and it soon became obvious that he could not stay any longer. Thus, Hjaldar built himself a pair of spring-loaded stilts, raising him to a handsome height of 195cm, towering even over most humans.

To complete his transition into human-hood, Hjaldar left his hometown, in which all knew his true identity, and started traveling the lands under his new, perfectly regular human name: “Tony Guy”. Tony Guy gives his best to blend in, and lives along humans on eye-level. But if anyone dares to insult his height or doubts his human identity, he drops from his stilts to drop to kneecap-crushing height, leaving his trench coat, glasses and hat behind, and falls into a naked rage. For some spectators, this looks like as if a tiny naked creature emerges from the trench coat, while Tony Guy, who in reality is just his clothes on a pair of stilts, stays behind.

  

# Alignment

Hjaldar lands in “Tradcon” on the incel alignment chart. Because he grew up in a rural village, he picked up his stance on women from the local elderly men who firmly believe that women belong in the kitchen and nowhere else. In his pursuit of becoming the most inconspicuous human possible, Hjaldar treasures all advice he gets from the must bland, basic variation of humans: Old, racist, sexist white men.
