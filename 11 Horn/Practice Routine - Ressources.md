> My recommendations are to practise the following things—not necessarily in the order given:  
> 1. ==Long notes==.  
> 2. Flexibility exercises.  
> 3. Scales and arpeggios.  
> 4. Lip trills.  
> 5. Control exercises.  
> These five main divisions cover the whole gamut of brass playing and each can be broken down into an infinite number of different exercises which, if pursued, could go on all day, leaving no time to practise études and solos. Therefore it is necessary to plan each day carefully, taking into consideration all the factors already referred to….

> Get in the habit of practicing “==extremes==”…. Practice that which is just beyond your ability and progress will soon be evident. By practicing “extremes” I mean the difficult phases of playing: extremely high or extremely low notes, extremely loud or extremely soft notes, very fast or very slow passages, etc.

> A well rounded practice routine should cover every note on the instrument from the highest to the lowest, playing each one of these notes from loud to soft, and in varied combinations. The routine should be so complete, so demanding, that after going through it, any written piece of music should be comparatively easier.
